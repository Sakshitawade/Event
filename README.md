# Event
**Introduction**


Events create opportunities for people to connect with an area, spend time together,
celebrate and experience the diversity of cultures and foster creativity and innovation. they allow
a community to come alive and provide an opportunity for a destination to showcase its tourism
experience and increase economic activity.
Events contribute significantly to community building, lifestyle and leisure enhancement,
cultural development, tourism promotion and increased visitation, volunteer participation,
fundraising and economic development. Most importantly, events create a sense of fun and
vibrancy, resulting in a strong sense of community connectivity, pride and a sense of place.
I created this website to publish my events ideas. Before I create this website I was not able
to communicate with customers or I was not able to reach the people from another places to
advertise my business. Also the people who needs an organiser for functions or event are not able
to contact me.
So I had find this solution to publish my business through website on worldwide. Now I am
able to reach and communicate with more people and also able to take orders online through
website. The customers can directly send mail through my website.

Event management is the application of project management to the creation and development of small and/or large-scale personal or corporate events such as festivals, conferences, ceremonies, weddings, formal parties, concerts, or conventions. It involves studying the brand, identifying its target audience, devising the event concept, and coordinating the technical aspects before actually launching the event.
